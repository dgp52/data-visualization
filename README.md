# Data Visualization - Exploratory Data Analysis on Google Play Store Apps Dataset

The goal of this project is to discover patterns, test different hypothesis or assumptions using visualizations. Further, 
we investigate the dataset to summarize main characteristics of the play store dataset. Once we thoroughly analyze the dataset, we 
will be able to draw insights which can help us make business decisions as beginner app developers.
